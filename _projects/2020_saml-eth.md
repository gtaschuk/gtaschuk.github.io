title: SAML x Web3 
---


<h3><a href='http://github.com/gtaschuk/saml-eth'>SAML-Eth</a> @ <a href='http://ethdenver.com'>EthDenver</a></h3>
<p>This hackathon project implements a SAML identity provider, so organizations can manage users across Web2 and Web3. This enables employees to sign into thousands of enterprise services via an ethereum wallet (we used the ShapeShift KeepKey) and enables organizations to manage in different groups. The ethereum smart contract that manages user permissions is a bitmask-rbac - maintaining roles that an employee might have in an organization and providing a natively ethereum way to manage their interaction with Ethereum contracts.
