Making craft beer at home is one of the most rewarding hobbies you can have.  It's also a hobby that requires some forethought to make good beer easily.  In this post I'll breakdown just one system for doing that, which happens to be mine.  I'll discuss some tradeoffs along the way.

If you spend about some money upfront you can make beers for 50 cents/ea for the rest of your life.

## Electric boilers

At the heart of your brewery is the boiler.  Whether electric, or a boil kettle, it heats the water to the temperatures you need to Mash, and Boil.  I opted for the appropriately named **Mash & Boil**, an electric boiler that heats up to 7.5 gallons/28 Liters of water to any temperature up to boiling.

Alternatively, you can opt for a brew kettle, which while slightly cheaper, means that you will have to control temperature yourself, which can be tedious on gas stoves not sized appropriately for a 5-6 gallon boil.

## Pump
A pump designed for high temperature liquids allows you to recirculate your wort, and pump it through a chiller, or into a fermenter.  I opted for the **Chugger pump**

## Fermentor
When I first started brewing, I bought plastic buckets, which, while cheap, and perfectly food safe, requires careful cleaning (to maintain sterility) - after a year or two you will likely replace them.  They also look like big plastic buckets which may or may not be a drawback.

One step up from that is a glass carboys, the choice brewers have been making for hundreds of years.  Unless broken, these will last for a long time, and it's easy to see how clean they are.

Profressional breweries use stainless steel tanks.  While glass was the natural choice for a long time, recently, stainless steel tanks have become available to homebrewers at good prices.  There are several great options, but I went with the **SS Brewtech BrewBucket**.  At $200, it's definitely pricey, but should theoretically last for a lifetime.  It has a valve at the bottom which makes it easy to transfer the liquid to other vessels, and a big lid that makes cleaning easy.  Since it's stainless, you can clean with normal dish sponges, which you cannot with plastic buckets.

## Hoses and Pipe fittings.
There are two types of hoses you should consider.

**Silicon hoses** are suited to transferring liquid at high temperatures, and won't transfer off flavors to the beer.  The inertness of silicon explains its use in medical applications.
**Vinyl tubing** is clear, and cheaper.  It's useful for pumping wort around, and makes cleanup a lot easier, because you can just pump cleaner and sanitizer through the whole thing

Brewday involves a lot of attaching and unattaching hoses.  To make your life easier, you can get quick disconnects which allow the hoses to easily attach and detach.
NPT means national pipe thread, it's a standard pipe thread that is compatible with a wide ranged of fittings.  It's brokend down into MPT, and FPT for male pipe thread and female pipe thread respectively.

Let's walk through the pipe fittings you need, by following the beer through the lines:

When the beer exits the mash and boil it enters a short 1/2" silicone hose.  To connect the other side of that hose to the pump, you'll need **Hose barb/female QD <=> male QD/MPT**.  The MPT threads screw into the smaller end of a reducer.  This let's us step up from a 1/2" tube to the 3/4" pump inlet.  Then the wort flows through the pump and then out into a **1/2" NPT ball valve**.  The ball valve allows you to control the rate of flow of the pump - closing it halfway makes the flow slower.  On the other side of the ball valve, you'll need another **MPT/male QD <=> female QD/hose barb**.  When the beer exits the pump it can go into multiple interchangeable hoses.  It can go into a hose to the top of the Mash & Boil, to recirculate the wort, or it can go into the chiller.  To account for the other hose, you'll need an extra **female QD/hose barb**.

## Extras
You'll need a **hydrometer** to measure specific gravity, a **thermometer**, a **large whisk or spoon** to stir the mash, and **cleaning and sanitizing supplies**, oh yeah, and a kegging system

## Kegging
Bottling is one of the most laborious steps in brewing, and it means that you have bottles everywhere constantly.  Also, bottle conditioning leaves a yeasty taste in the bottom of the bottle, and takes a longer time - there's a reason very few commercial beers are bottle conditioned.

Kegging is much simpler.  When the beer is done fermenting, you just put it in a keg, carbonate it under high pressure for a day or two, and then serve.  At the very least, you'll need **kegs**, a **CO2 tank**, a **regulator**, **gas and beer lines** and a **faucet**.  I put these things in a kegerator - a mini fridge I converted to dispense homebrew.
