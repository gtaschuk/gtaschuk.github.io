When I tried to learn German as an adult, I began with Duolingo.  It quickly immerses you in vocab through a series of lessons that amount to roughly a year or two of language classes.  Once finished, I Wanted to continue learning, in a low effort, passive way.

I began by trying to watch movies and shows in German.  While I could understand much of it, not being able to easy to stop and look up words (as we would with text) definitely made it hard to keep up with the finer points.

When I turned on English subtitles, I found it too tempting to read the english subtitles, ignoring the German audio playing in the background.

So I wrote a script, to show me definitions for words that I did not know yet in the subtitles track.  As I learned these words, I added to the list, so that fewer and fewer words appeared in the track.

In many languages, including english, 1000 words roughly equates to 95% of words used in common speech.  This amounted to roughly as many words as I had learned in Duolingo - enough speech so that the new-vocabulary in the subtitles wouldn't be incredibly intrusive, yet there would be enough words to continue learning.

When I'm watching movies in foreign languages, I just alt-tabbing to a list of words that I knew to add words.
